# sms
This is my intial project called student management system(sms) which is based on PHP, MYSQL, HTML and CSS. 
This project help me a lot of things in understanding how the dynamic website is running in any server.
In this project you can store the database of students by filling the form of students which was given in the admin panel of the website.
Actually the admin of this website can only store the data of the student and any one can see their database in home page of the website by enter some details of the students.
By working on this small project, i have learnt about the login & logout system, take the data by html form and store in the database by using MYSql query.
